From RCNN to mask-RCNN
---------
while reading paper [RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524), I am not clear about how selection search works.
This is explained in [Selective Search for Object Recognition](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.414.1971&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

The first step is based on [Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf). The authors use graph theory to construct regional proposal.
